        <h1>My Favorite Hobbies</h1>
        <p>
            There are a couple of things I enjoy doing with my spare time and that would be playing video games, watching anime, drawing, and creating custom clothing.
            My most favorite hobby would hands down have to be playing video games. I get so much enjoyment from playing video games because it can take you
            anywhere. It can be a fantasy game that would never happen in real life, an apoclypse, something more realistic with humans and guns, etc. They will 
            make you forget about what is happening in the real world and let you enjoy yourself with the time alone or even with friends. There are millions of 
            games out there, it just takes finding that right game to get you hooked. There are many genres of games that you are bound to find something that 
            interests you that will make you unable to put the game down. <br>
            My other hobbies do the same thing just in a different sense. You can find enjoyment in anything. Just make sure no one discourages you from finding 
            what you love to do. Here is a link where you can download most games:
